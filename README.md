# AI Model Evolution and Classification

This project was developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence** coursework at **Queen Mary University of London** for the MSc Artificial Intelligence program.

It includes implementations of two core components:
- A **Genetic Algorithm** for evolving neural network architectures.
- A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification using the FashionMNIST dataset.

The project demonstrates practical understanding of evolutionary optimization and deep learning techniques.
